willie:

what was it like

* don't have another product mind to bounce things off of
* CEO/CTO can have a "that's my baby" syndrome that clouds product thinking
* job is small data "let me talk to the engineers on this" - there's only one and he/she better be right
* since PM isn't so established, people dont understand your job scope, so communicating that is a bit of overhead

alejandro:

* anyone can change anything, you want an expresso machine, you can make that happen. you want a new pitch deck, done.
* you should have strong opinions. you should be able to defend them. no flip-flopping. be decisive
* dont get distracted by process. have a good process - if it works it works. dont formalize things. agile purity is not a goal in itself, being great and delivering on time is the goal.
*
