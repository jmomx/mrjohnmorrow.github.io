I recently stumbled across some spam on Facebook and found it difficult to report the post as spam. Facebook is a great website that has done a lot to combat spam, however there is still much room for improvement. Facebook's spam reporting UI has too many steps, those steps are confusing, and do not provide helpful options if you manage to make it all the way through.  

# At first, things seem great

When I see the spam post in my feed, I immediatley click the caret in the corner of the post to report it. The report option is easy to find and I click it. That was easy!

But wait, there's more!

# The process has only just begun

Oh ok well now I have to choose an option to help Facebook figure out what's wrong with the post. Ok Facebook, that's cool I can help you with that real quick.

# Ok, now this is getting ridiculous

So I guess I'm still not done.

I think all three of these are true. This type of multiple choice, where you have to pick form the best of many good answers, is kind of difficult. If you have ever looked at a question from the analytical reasoning section [of the LSAT](https://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/sample-lsat-test-questions.aspx), they use this to gauge intelligence.  At this point I don't know what to do so I just choose the first one, because I don't know Nicole at all (she is a friend of a friend) and so the other to options are unverifiable.  Well maybe I could verify them, but I'm not some sleuthing social media vigilante and I just want to get this over with.

# Oh ok, I guess I can't report this as spam after all
Now Facebook presents me with yet another screen. Three levels deep, and yes time does feel like it is passing more slowly as a slowly drown in a morass of tedium.
