* Mad Men creates a less vapid sort of mystery.  The coen brothers said that they were inspired by RAymond chandler's character driven mystery with The Big Lebowski, this is in the same vein. and When Lost asks questions, it's about plot.  When Mad Men asks questions, it's about characters.
* The perfect show, nothing would ever happen.
* Mad Men has changed the way I feel about narrative fiction
* Even the humor comes from characters in a way other shows fail - Ken's father in law talking about "cooking" a pop tart.
