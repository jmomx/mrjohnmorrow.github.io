My friends in the amazing band [The Papers](http://thepapersmusic.com) created a Kickstarter for their music / art project [The Paper Trail](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791710722/the-paper-trail-0) that if you haven't already seen, you should check out. It's a cool concept - videos from all around the world as a visual accompaniment for their latest album. Considering I am riding my bike around all the time already, it seemed easy to just strap my phone to my bike and take a video.  To collect the video, Mike from The Papers sent me a link to a Dropbox folder to upload the video. It turns out that this scenario is supported very poorly.

I collected about 30 minutes of footage that was a little over 5gb in total size. However, because I am a new Dropbox user, my account is limited to 2gb in uploads.  This shouldn't be problem since The Papers have a pro subscription
