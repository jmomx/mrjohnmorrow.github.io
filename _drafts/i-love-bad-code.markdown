I recently came across the [story](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~elb/folklore/mel.html) of a programmer "Mel", who didn't view maintainable code as a feature, but a bug resultant of intellectual inferiority. I often discuss code quality with developers I work with, and at [Gigster](http://gigster.com), ensuring code quality on the products we deliver has become an instrumental part of our business. And - don't get me wrong - I love architecting efficient and maintainable systems.  It's an important part of building any software that provides lasting value. However, have a confession to make...

I love bad code

To be clear, if it doesn't compile or it doesn't run, it is of no interest to me. But when someone piles together a teetering, precariously perched pile of unintelligible ascii characters that someone works, I'm not just interested, I'm fascinated.
