In the wake of the unspeakable tragedy in las Vegas, my social media became overrun with posts about it. To my surprise, the posts were not mostly in support of victims - the plurality of the posts were actually in response to the media coverage, which was admonished for failing to call the shooter a terrorist. As futile as posting can be, at least the usual outpouring of platitudes can unite the community (which, in my most optimistic hour, I believe Facebook to be) However, the misguided case of The People vs. CNN et al serves no purpose. it is a moral failing to focus on media coverage and not on the real matter at hand - one of the deadliest domestic events of any of our lifetimes.  This is not a one-off failure of a few, but a consistent problem in left-leaning political circles in the US. As someone


## Was the media coverage biased?

 In general, I agree with many of my friends who feel the media is biased towards lionizing white shooters as “troubled souls” while jumping to conclusions on shooters of just about any other race and calling them “terrorists”.  However, there is a very clear definition of a terrorist (from Google, other sources were similar):

ter·ror·ist
ˈterərəst/Submit
noun
1.
a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
"four commercial aircraft were hijacked by terrorists"
synonyms:	extremist, fanatic; More
adjective
1.
unlawfully using violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
"a terrorist organization"

The shooter doesn’t meet this definition.  It makes a clear distinction that there must be a goal beyond the mere creation of violence.  From the interviews done with the shooter’s family, girlfriend, and neighbors; as well as the search of his homes and hotel room, there appears to be no clear motive to his actions.  This is almost impossible to imagine - could this have really happened for no reason? As more information comes forth, I actually hope some motive emerges. If just to provide a semblance of closure to the families of the scores slaughtered, the hundreds injured, and the thousands who were trapped out there, unarmed on a battlefield they never chose to enter, and that they surely will never forget. The children at that concert will still remember this day 100 years from now.

## If it was

Let’s say that the shooter was a muslim terrorist. Or even, that the definition of terrorism is wrong and the word should pertain to any mass violence. Sure, the media would absolutely be encouraging a bias that white men would benefit from. However this is an absurd thing to focus on. One man may have benefited from privilege, but dozens of people were just killed. Hundreds are in local hospitals who are running out of blood. Also, if we don’t forget, this man is dead. The true privilege he got was that even after he died, people responded not with sympathy for his victims, but with indignation at his perceived benefit. Even with his despicable acts, and his victims tragic, pointless sacrifice, he still gets preference.

## a moral failing

As the Onion (never fails to remind us)[http://www.theonion.com/article/no-way-prevent-says-only-nation-where-regularly-ha-57086], these shootings are preventable. Legislation similar to what has been enacted in dozens of other countries could all but eliminate these events. However, there is a vast expanse separating the country on how we might prevent these occurrences. Moments like these are the one of the few chances that we have to get people to consider working together to make a change. Many of those whose complaints I saw on Facebook are for gun control, if not all of them. As am I. There are two questions we need to ask here:
1) How could this be prevented?
2) How do people who are not for gun control feel this could be prevented?

We need to find an overlap between these. Complaining about the media for perpetuating privilege will in no way help, it will only use vocabulary that further alienates the exact people you need to convince to work with you to support lifesaving legislation. White privilege is a huge issue. But complaining about equality between different races of mass shooter is just ridiculous. Imagine you solve this problem. What does that look like? All mass shooters are now treated equally? What might that accomplish - most of these people do not survive long the day of the shooting, let alone long enough to see this privilege or experience this racism.

Textbook definition of terrorism says otherwise:

ter·ror·ism - ˈterəˌrizəm' n.

the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

Is it wrong? My question is - does it matter?

For these victims, and their families, I don't think this distinction is important. Terrorism or not, this attack was certainly terrifying. The children who witnessed it will still remember it in 100 years. It likely could have been prevented. The attitudes of media and many individuals toward the shooter are undoubtedly influenced by race. I think it would be easy to get distracted by this here. I am more interested in two other questions:

How could this have been prevented?
How do pro-gun people think this could have been prevented?

If there is any overlap there, there is a political will to change this. A change here, could save lives.
