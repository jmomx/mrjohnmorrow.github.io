 - Just like most teams
 - However you need to minimize communication overhead

 Ways to do that:
  - Reduce questions on overall direction by strong direction setting
  -  More thorough planning to reduce ad-hoc information requests
  - Better documentation
  - Process that adds value, constantly tweaked to meet needs
  - Incentivizing cooperation
  - Culture of regularly scheduled meetings that are always attended
