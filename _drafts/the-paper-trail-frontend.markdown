* Tried purecss.io

* Tried raw css

* Settled on bootstrap
* was already using Jquery
* seemed to get me the biggest head start


* designing for a fixed height (figure out what to call this) forces you to move off standard responsive design techniques for things like horizontal flowing lists

* don't add a folder called 'resources" in an xcode project
