> "Incontestable that nothing in life is more uplifting than righteous anger" - Philip Roth [1]

 - Hegel uses the platonic concept of "thymos", alongside desire and reason, to describe the soul. By thymos he clarifies the original definition "spiritedness" as a desire for recognition
 - In less philosophical terms, you can thing of this as merely desiring the approval of others
 - In a economically liberal society, this often is associated with greater wealth, as illustrated in Caplan's *The Case Against Education*.
 - Judeo-Christian values dominated Western civilization for two thousand years, or more importantly, through post industrialization
 - These certainly had negative effects, and I wouldn't begin to compare those with the positive, but they did certainly help create a clear social hierarchy for people to strive to climb, and there was a clear path to satisfying thymos
 - Most belief systems have two ways of satisfying thymos:
  -  A consequentialist basis, either via helping others or in some cases, like with Nietzscheans or moral relativists, by being great
  - A deontological basis, for instance, notions of purity, piousness, etc. "Do what you can to help people, but good christians also pray everyday"
 - No value system has replaced christian values in western society, which makes conforming pretty confusing
- Many people still share some consequentialist values, e.g. very few people are complaining when you donate money to Tsunami victims
 - However, the drive to achieve recognition is very strong
- It's really hard in the chaotic modern world to even know if your actions truly help people
- People do not have the equivalent of praying / showing up at church
- Idpol gives people this
 - Idpol's notion of goodness, often called wokeness, allows people to feel satisfaction by merely having the right opinions
 - Finding a new person to hate, or company to hate, etc. allows peopple to feel this thymos satisfying righteous anger
 - Sharing this on social media is the social equivalent of going to church, your followers are often the community that you would like to impress the same way you would your fellow parishioners at church
- "Calling people out," "educating," "not tolerating ____", "bringin attention to" are very much a ways to tie the demostrative actions loosely to
 - This creates a system that is:
  1. Judgemental
  2. Unforgiving
  3. Irrational to participate in

 - This:
  - Erodes discourse, the painfully compromised conversation where you have to give credence to truly hateful and terrible opinions in order to
  "entertain the idea someone is right for just long enough to understand how to make an argument as to why you are right"
  - Creates a cost to changing your mind, where you could "get cancelled"
  - Creates a self reinforcing belief system that is unable to evolve its points to create any nuance
