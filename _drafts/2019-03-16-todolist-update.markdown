So in the few short weeks since my [last post]({% post_url 2019-01-06-todolist %}), Memobird has discontinued their IFTTT endpoint and it is now _impossible_ to send custom content to the Memobird printer. However, never one to take no for answer, I pestered the good folks at Memobird until they gave me access to their private API. I'll be writing a little guide to help other people work around the retirement of their IFTT endpoint. To gt started you will need to:

* Submit a ticket on the [Memobird support site] (https://support.mymemobird.com/portal/home) to get an API access key.  They aren't like, just handing these things out willy-nilly, so you might need to ask for a refund first or resort to some other more creative histrionics to get one.
