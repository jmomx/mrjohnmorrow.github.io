### On the awy to Asti

* I leave Milan and by 4pm I am struggling with a terrible cold. Stop in Vigevano for the night
* I stop in Vignale Monferatto, which is super in the middle of nowhere. Like, I'm pretty sure I could see Jupiter moons with my bare eye middle of nowhere
* I spend two days recuperating at a farmstay "agritourismo"
* Get to Asti, still recuperating but at least get to drink some good wine. there is real internet here

### Asti
* Stop next in the Commune di Barolo, home of the famous Barolo wine, stopping for a tour of a grappa distillery on the way
* I mail back to seattle most of my things due to a backpack issue
* Barolo is great and I want to stay but I really want to get to genoa and then france because i am way behind schedule at this point
* in the first few weeks of my trip (until i left milan) I had done astonishingly little biking, but now I am really putting in the miles and feet (of altitude)

### Barolo

From Barolo, I began to bike to Mondivi, where I could get a train across the seaside alps to Savona. On the way there, i get two flat tires. I then took a train to Nice so I could buy a new tire to continue on bike to Cannes and Marseille. Nice is lively and the food is great. It's also good to be somewhere where  I can communicate again! I can already hear my french improving!
