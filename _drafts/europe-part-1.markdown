### Prelude

I've been on a few long vacations in my short life.  Each time I travel, my parents send me a barrage of emails inquiring about my location and health, never to receive more than a laconic "aliv [sic] in _____.  EOM".  One time I accidentally sent an email with one character in the subject line, and figured that was sufficient since it was unlikely that I would have sent any email at all if something went wrong. Anyway, I figured that this time I might try to document things a little more throughly, if not for other people (like my parents) to read, at least to help me recall my own experiences a little better.

New York

On my way to Berlin, I stopped in New York for the weekend to see friends and family. I stayed with Jean and my friend Chris, both of whom somehow have large, affordable apartments in Manhattan.  Being back in New York felt great - I forgot how much I missed the city and how many friends I have here. It amazes me how in a city as expensive as New York, you can still get a slice of pizza for a dollar! You can't get pizza for a dollar anywhere in Seattle and the cost of living is much lower. Jean and I got dinner with Rebecca an Graham, the latter who I hadn't seen in years.


Berlin

Due to strong tailwinds, my flight arrived 90 minutes early (though it was fairly turbulent). It was great to see Cathy and entertaining as always. She had a lot of stories about our family that I had never heard before. Craziest one - that David's uncle died in a shootout with police. We went to Andreas's restaurant with her friend Olga, who interestingly enough wrote an operatic adaptation of David Lynch's Lost Highway.  Andreas's restaurant wasn't really open yet, so we had to go out for schnitzel afterwards, but it was still fun to check out. We also went to this weird birthday party that was actually pretty fun - many of the attendees were actors who are about as friendly a breed of german as you can find (which isn't saying much).  I didn't go out to much in Berlin - I tried to go to Berghain but not surprisingly didn't get in (it's famously hard - I think Jean went once though).

Bologna

Now, in light of recent events, flying over the alps in a Germanwings plane might not be everyones idea of a great time, but for $70 (incl. a free cheese sandwich!), I couldn't complain. As soon as I get into Bologna, the language barrier becomes obvious when the bus driver can't explain to me how I am supposed to pay for the bus and I end up "hopping the turnstile" when I get to my destination without buying a ticket.  Most people in Italy don't speak english so I have gotten good at a combination of franticly using google translate, pantomime, and prop-comedy to communicate. In Bologna I ate spaghetti every day and walked around the beautiful old streets.  It was raining, but in Bologna all of the sidewalks are covered so it wasn't a problem. Meeting people was really easy in Bologna. I didn't even finish my first drink before someone asked me where I was from and invited me to join their friend's birthday party. In smaller cities like Bolonga, people seem genuinely excited that an American is there and are eager to talk to you and tell you what you should do. One person at the birthday party even volunteered to (and then did, along with her dog!) show me around the next day.  I got into Bologna on Good Friday so I had to wait until the following Tuesday for stores to open so I could buy a bike. Used bike stores were useless - one tried to sell me a decrepit piece of shit for $240 euros and another had no adult size bikes. I ended up buying a new single-speed for $300.  I had a rack put on for another $50 (which was not a good deal, as I later found out) and was on my way.

* Paying for the bus was so confusing I accidentally "hopped the turnstyle"
* TAgliatelle al ragu every day so far
