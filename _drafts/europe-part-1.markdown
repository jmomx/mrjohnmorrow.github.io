### Prelude

I've been on a few long vacations in my short life.  Each time I travel, my parents send me a barrage of emails inquiring about my location and health, never to receive more than a laconic "aliv [sic] in _____.  EOM".  One time I accidentally sent an email with one character in the subject line, and figured that was sufficient since it was unlikely that I would have sent any email at all if something went wrong. Anyway, I figured that this time I might try to document things a little more throughly, if not for other people (like my parents) to read, at least to help me recall my own experiences a little better.

### New York

* Stayed at jean and chris's
* artichoke not as good as i remembered
* dollar pizza is still the most amazing thing to me
* forgot how many people I knew in New York
* smells a lot better in the winter
* campari is 35 dollars

### Berlin

* My flight arrived 90 minutes early
* CAthy is very interesting
* mustang wanted stayed at her house
* literally can't stop talking, could give her own eulogy, thought I've never heard her talk in her sleep
* Neukoln is more dense than I remember
* Everyone dresses well
* Lots of australians, sounds like a great place by why does no one want to stay there
* Spend a lot of my time working in coffee shops
* Meet her friend olga, who wrote an opera adaptation of David Lynch's lost highway
* ate a good schnitzel at jolesch
* made a crossword puzzle
* went to my uncles restaurant which has been in a soft open for over a year - hot pea soup with chorizo
* campari is 10 euros
* tried to go to berghain but i didnt get in
* deiter roth exibit and then then ragnar kjartnnson beuys

### Bologna

* $70 to fly, cheese sandwich was free and not bad (germanwings over the alps though)
* Paying for the bus was so confusing I accidentally "hopped the turnstyle"
* TAgliatelle al ragu every day so far
* Beautiful, old streets.  Sidewalks are at least 80% covered in the old ity center - why doesn't Seattle do that too?
* Buying a bike or a new SIM card was nigh impossible from friday - monday
* tigelles and mortadella
* meeting people was really easy, didn't even finish my first drink before someone invited me to their birthday party. friend took me out to dinner and we went on a walk with her dog
* shared bathroom - really proud i didn't pee in my sink
* finally go the bike at a new bike store, used places were useless, rack installed and ready to go
