I have interviewed at about a dozen companies for positions as a either a developer or PM. Almost all of those interviews have been the same - four to six hour-long one-on-one interviews with current employees.  I haven't had a lot of experience hiring, but as a candidate I am always trying to figure out if a job is a good fit for me. To determine a fit an interview should - at the very least - the following two things:

* Allow the company to ascertain if the applicant would be successful at the job in question
* Allow the applicant to learn about what it would be like to work at the company

Recently interviewed for a position as a Product Manager at a small start-up in San Francisco called [Gigster](http://trygigster.com). They used a different format which I thought felt like a much more straightforward and effective way to judge a candidate. The interview consisted of two short one-on-one interviews, and then a 3-4 hour practical.

### The Interviews


The night before the on-site I had a short phone call with a founder who described the interview process to me for the first time.  He also gave me access to the company's Git repo, slack channels, and customer feedback data. I had until the next morning to absorb as much as I could, and also sleep a little. I had two one-on-ones with each founder. They asked mostly design based questions, e.g.:

* What is a product you like? Describe how the UI works and how you would change it if you worked there? I picked Snapchat.
* What are the metrics that would define the success of the Google Search Page? How could you make it better? How would it effect those metrics?
* One of our product goals is maintaining customer satisfaction (actual question was more specific, but I don't want to talk product specifics publicly). Here's part of the product - does it do a good job of achieving that goal? How can we make it better?

Both founders were focused on keeping things conversational, and so we ended up discussing my experience and how it prepared me to contribute without explicitly prompting it.  It would be hard to say that my one-on-one interviews at other companies were interrogations, but they definitely fall on a spectrum from friendly to adversarial. These fell firmly on the friendly side, and in doing so gave me a better opportunity to ask questions and learn more about the founders and the company.

### The Practical

For the practical I was given a few hours to put together a pitch on two questions:

* For a product area, analyze the current solution and provide a prioritized list of product improvements?
* For that same area, pick a specific piece of the UI and design an improvement.

So I actually thought the 4 hours I was given was going to be enough time to do this, but since I hadn't really gotten a chance to use the software too much before the practical session, I had to spend a lot of time just gathering information from cust. sat. reports and trying out various parts of the product. I ended up not quite finishing both questions, and the visuals couldn't have been more crude. However once again I got to talk through the deck I made with the founders, and we got into a long discussion about success metrics and analysis that covered a few of the things that I couldn't get to in my deck.

### Why is this better?

I can't really speak for the founders who interviewed me, but I felt at the very least that my ability to demonstrate my effectiveness was as high or higher in this interview format. I don't think it is necessary for a job interview to try to emulate the day-to-day of the position, but it seemed like a really effective way to achieve the two goals I mention above - especially the second. I got to learn what kind of problems I would be solving, and then in the review of my practical, the product thinking of the company I would be working for.

### Preparing for the Practical Interview

So, in case you were wondering, I got the job. Here are some things I did to prepare and how effective I thought they were:

1. **Write down well thought-out answers to all of the interview questions you have gotten before.** I asked around as well and got a few friends to tell me questions they had been asked to add to the list. This was pretty helpful for a few reasons:

* It made me think about how to frame my past contributions, and maybe the words to describe them fresher in my mind.

2. **Try to guess what the practical work is and do it ahead of time.**

* I got used to using the tools I would be using the next day. I made a few diagrams in Powerpoint and then also started making some design mocks in Photoshop the day before.  I definitely felt more com
* This got me thinking about the company and the product, loading my mental cache for the next day
