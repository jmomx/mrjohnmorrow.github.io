### Getting to Parma

* 90km
* bag rack broke 3 times.  Corner store owner and moped repair shop saved my life
* My ass was not prepared for 210 lbs of weight
* stopped in Modena, scarfed and napped
* One gear - no problems
* didn't have time to stop and try the aceto classico or cheese in Reggio-Emilia

### Parma

* small version of bologna
* salsciccia sandwich reminded me of joes gelateria in welland ontario
* Beautiful park (what's it called)
* enotecha
* got a stronger rack - lets see how this goes
* the internet here is terrible
* I met some people in Parma that were friends with the people I met in Bologna

### Bikes in Italy

* Bikes are everywhere. I have seen numerous septagenarians on bikes.
* Cars tend to gives you good space on the road

### Speaking Italian

* I cant do it. Most people don't speak english, but often other patrons act as interpreters.
* Pointing, pantomime and prop comedy have come in handy
