### Getting to Parma

* 90km
* bag rack broke 3 times.  Corner store owner and moped repair shop saved my life
* My ass was not prepared for 210 lbs of weight
* stopped in Modena, scarfed and napped
* One gear - no problems
* didn't have time to stop and try the aceto classico or cheese in Reggio-Emilia

### Parma

* small version of bologna
* salsciccia sandwich reminded me of joes gelateria in welland ontario
* Beautiful park (what's it called)
* enotecha
* got a stronger rack - lets see how this goes
* the internet here is terrible
* I met some people in Parma that were friends with the people I met in Bologna

### Bikes in Italy

* Bikes are everywhere. I have seen numerous septagenarians on bikes.
* Cars tend to gives you good space on the road

### Speaking Italian

* I cant do it. Most people don't speak english, but often other patrons act as interpreters.
* Pointing, pantomime and prop comedy have come in handy
* Taking 5 minutes to order a drink is a great way to meet people. English speakers flock to a struggling anglophone.

### Milan

* I stopped for a night in Piancenza on my way to Milan, and went to restaurant that only served horse. I also broke my power converter and when I went to an electronics store, they gave me a new one for free! I made the mistake of not booking a place to stay in Milan in advance - Design Week (insert link) was just starting as arrived.  Everything in the city of Milan was booked - hostels, hotels, etc. The cheapest thing ended up being an Airbnb (for $200 a night :(), but I didn't want to stay outside of the city. I think the only reason it wasn't booked was because there were no reviews. However, I didn't really have a choice so I booked it anyways (it ended up being very nice).

* Navigli - canal? or river in Milan with a ton of restaurants and bars
* Colonne square where everyone drinks
* For design week, their were events all over via tortona
* Met some students who were studying and we went to the club
* Met up with them the next day too, met some americans at a bar and then also went to club called "the club"
* food in milan has been gret - had macaroni and cheese that was cooked on a flaming wheel of grana padano
* had a veal milanese which I didn't realize was just a schnitzel
* chinatown was great - converter was so cheap and so was the wrench
* also flaming mac and cheese
