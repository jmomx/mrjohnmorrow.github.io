"Life, it's all a big nothing you know" - Livia Soprano

I've spent a lot of time in my life thinking about what to do with the rest of it.  
It's a question that can take up a lot of your time - if you don't have a good answer,
you'll have to try to answer that question every day. 


I have been lucky enough to be born into a circumstance and a time where scarcity and 
threats of violence do not play a large role in my day to day life. There's a proverb,
attributed to the Buddhists, but I don't think anyone really knows where it's from - 
"No food, one problem. Lots of food, many problems." This certainly has some truth,
but I have noticed a common thread between these "many problems." You need to create
a balance between desire and success in your life. You need to do things you enjoy, 
but you also need to do things that set you up for success later in life. Neitzsche
called this the Appollonian / Dionysian dichotomy (and I'm pretty sure he took that 
from the greeks, but its not like I'm reading Euripedes so AFAIK he invented it).  
I really enjoy this Simpsons clip on Youtube (The Constant Agony of Hans Moleman),
but I can't just keep watching videos for any period of time. The more I indulge Dionysus,
the less enjoyment I get from it.  Alternatively, you can not only strive towards 
Appolonian pursuits, or you can lose motivation - if you never get to indulge, what 
is the point of all of the hard work? 

As I get older, I noticed the line between Dionysus and Appolo blurring. There are 
things that can be both challenging and enjoyable; I've heard these called "type II fun".
For example exercise or raising a family can both be very difficult, but people often cannot
decouple that from the deep enjoyment they get from them.
