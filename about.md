I am a product manager and developer living in Oakland, CA.  I am from Buffalo, NY, and came to the great State of California after spending time in Seattle and at Cornell University. For a little more info about what I've done, click on the "Work" link above or take a look at my [resume](/JohnMorrowResume.pdf).
