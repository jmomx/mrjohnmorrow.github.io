![Me!](/images/me-potrait.jpg)

I am a product manager and developer living in San Francisco, CA.  I am from Buffalo, NY, and came to the great State of California via Cornell University. For a little more info about what I've done, click on the "Work" link above or take a look at my [resume](http://mrjohnmorrow.com/JohnMorrowResume.pdf). For any inquiries about freelance work or consulting, feel free to contact me via the information below.

I am always down to play a game of correspondence chess - [send me a challenge on chess.com](http://www.chess.com/echess/create_game?uid=11525784).
