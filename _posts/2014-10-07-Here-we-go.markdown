I'm starting this blog as a place for me to share my personal projects. One of the things I am building is this very blog, and I am going to write blog posts about the changes I make and problems I encounter while building it.  Here's what the blog looks like to begin with:

![Standard Jekyll layout](/images/original-blog-layout.png)


I am building it with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) based on the [Jekyll new theme](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new). I already can think of a slew of improvements I want to add:

* Links to edit posts on github (like on [haacked.com](http://haacked.com))
* Better layout and design
* Pages with multiple posts
* A link to my Facebook page and LinkedIn

But first, I'm going to check this in to github and publish this as my first commit.

Here we go.
