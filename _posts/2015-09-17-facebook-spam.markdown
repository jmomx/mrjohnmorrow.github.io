Facebook has come a long way over the years in its fight against spam.  What was once commonplace is now a rare occurrence, no doubt a result of [their impressive spam fighting technology](https://code.facebook.com/posts/745068642270222/fighting-spam-with-haskell/). However, in my recent experience with trying to report a spam post, I learned that this was despite the UX they use to allow you to report posts. Facebook's spam reporting UI has too many steps, those steps are confusing, and do not provide helpful options if you manage to make it all the way through.  I could calmly explain the issues with this UI, but there's nothing interesting in that, so I'm just going to rant about it instead.

# My Experience

The spam post I encounter is a confusing one. First, it's a life event ([what even are those](http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2015/06/sneakerheads-what-are-those) anyway?) posted by a stranger, in which a friend was tagged. I am puzzled by why I am seeing this post at all, because it is a post from someone who I am not friends with and have never heard of before.

Since this is clearly spam, I immediately click the caret in the corner of the post to report it. That was easy - oh wait, there's more!


Oh ok well now I have to choose an option to help Facebook figure out what's wrong with the post. Ok Facebook, that's cool, I can help you with that real quick.

 Done! Great!

 No, actually not even half way there. The next step wants me to figure out what kind of spam it is.

I think all three of these are true. This type of multiple choice, where you have to pick form the best of many good answers, is kind of difficult. If you have ever looked at a question from the analytical reasoning section [of the LSAT](https://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/sample-lsat-test-questions.aspx), they use this to gauge intelligence.  I clearly am not smart enough for the Facebook Spam Aptitude Test because I don't know what to do here, so I just choose the first one. I don't know Nicole at all (she is a friend of a friend) and so the other to options are unverifiable.  Well maybe I could verify them, but I'm not some sleuthing social media vigilante and I just want to get this over with.


Now Facebook presents me with yet another screen. I'm finally three levels deep, and yes time does feel like it is passing more slowly as the tedium beings to consume me.

Ah yes, at this final screen, the Sisyphean nature of my task is revealed! You can't actually report this as spam. No, I am told to either message someone I don't know, or block a friend who didn't even post the content to begin with.

# The Question Remains

I'm sure that if I hadn't taken a wrong turn in the labyrinth of menus I encountered, I might not have hit such an unhelpful dead end. This is one of the pitfalls of making complicated UX like this - you have a lot of things you need to get right. With simpler menu options, it makes it easier to guarantee that users would have a good experience. On top of this, simpler UX is often just better in it's own right, not just because its easier to do well. Now, I'm sure that whoever made this UI didn't decide to make it this complicated - it was the result of balancing a slew of objectives, and I'm not sure what all of those are. For instance, if they are trying to minimize false positives, then I'm sure this UI, which thoroughly discourages users from reporting spam at all, might do a good job at this. However, with an experience this unpleasant, and this unhelpful, the question remains - what is the point?
